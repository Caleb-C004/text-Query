CENG 5363 - Transportation Network Analysis
Introduction to planning and optimization techniques for the analysis of
transportation networks. Principles of precise algorithms for finding
transport network equilibrium flows and applications that relate to these
flows. Topics include routing algorithms, user equilibrium traffic
assignments, system optimal, stochastic user equilibrium, traffic
paradox, origin-destination matrix estimation, and transportation
network design.
Prerequisite: CENG 4351, CENG 5354 or equivalent or department chair
approval.
