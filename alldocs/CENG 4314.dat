CENG 4314 - Advanced Structural Analysis
This course builds upon the material covered in CENG 3325 to develop
a better understanding of structural behavior. Matrix analysis methods,
including an introduction to finite elements, are developed as the basis
for modern, computer-based structural analysis. These and other
advanced analytical techniques are used to analyze and design trusses,
beams, and frames. Course-work involves extensive use of the computer
as an analytical tool.
Prerequisite: CENG 3325. Co-listed with CENG 5314.
