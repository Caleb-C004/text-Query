EENG 5330 - Communication Systems Engineering
Review of the principles of amplitude and frequency modulation. The
main focus for the course will be the reliability issues for digital
communication systems. This will include but is not limited to
information theory and coding theory. Typical base-band and pass-band
modulation schemes will be analyzed in terms of their bit error rate
(BER) performance. Examples taken from telephone line modems will
be discussed. Link budget analysis appropriate for satellite and fiberoptics
communication systems will also be covered. Three hours of
lecture per week.
Prerequisite: EENG 4312 or equivalent, or consent of instructor.
