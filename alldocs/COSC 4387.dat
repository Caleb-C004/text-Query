COSC 4387 - Computer Performance Evaluation
Discrete and continuous simulation of dynamic systems. Topics include:
simulation of probabilistic systems; mathematical models of real
systems; system classifications; random number generators; simulation
languages; single queue and queue networks. Workloads, benchmarks,
performance measurement techniques, and case studies will be used in
system capacity planning, hardware selection and upgrade, and
performance tuning.
Prerequisite: COSC 3325.
