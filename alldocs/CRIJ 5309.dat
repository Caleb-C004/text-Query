CRIJ 5309 - Seminar in Criminal Justice Administration
Using case study as its principal methodology and moving from
theoretical propositions to practical considerations, this course examines
a range of concepts developed in the managements and organization
literature as applied in the administration of criminal justice agencies. A
criminal justice system perspective is achieved by examining selected
issues involving the administration of police departments, prosecutors'
and public defenders' offices, jails and prisons, and probation and parole
offices. Particular emphasis will be placed on leadership and workplace
issues.
