COSC 5377 - Fundamentals of Modeling and Distributed
Simulation of Complex Systems
This course aims to teach the fundamentals of modeling, simulation,
distributed simulation, and large-scale asynchronous distributed
simulation of real systems on parallel processors. Examples from the real
world include CAD of digital systems, IVHS transportation, military
command and control, medical networks, banking networks, and
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks.
