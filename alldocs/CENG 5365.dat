CENG 5365 - Dynamic Transportation Network Modeling
Introduction to the optimization and modeling methodologies required
for the analysis of dynamic and stochastic transportation networks.
Principles of dynamic network equilibrium via simulation and
mathematical programming approaches. Topics include time-dependent
routing algorithms, analytical-, cell transmission- and simulation-based
dynamic traffic assignment, network paradoxes, network reliability,
dynamic network design, and some stochastic extensions.
Prerequisite: CENG 5363 and Department Chair approval.
