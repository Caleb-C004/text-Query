COSC 5378 - Applied Computer Graphics
This graduate level course will begin with the basic theory of
computational graphics, describe important applications, especially in
the fields of medicine and GIS, and require students to complete a
substantial applied project utilizing graphical tools and packages that are
widely used in industry and the computer graphics community. The basic
theory will build on mathematical foundation and focus on geometric
primitives, color models, coordinate systems, transformation of object
views in 2D and 3D, projection, illumination, reflection, shading, and ray
tracing.
