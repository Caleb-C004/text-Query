CENG 4315 - Senior Design II
The senior design project, which was proposed and approved in CENG
4115, continues to completion. This capstone design project builds on
previous course work, includes all stages of the design process, and takes
into account a variety of realistic constraints such as manufacturability
and sustainability; economic factors; and environmental, safety and
reliability issues. Preparation and presentation of final oral and written
reports are required. Nine hours of Design Studio per week.
Prerequisite: CENG 4115.
