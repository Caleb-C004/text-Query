CENG 5324 - Advanced Mechanics of Materials
Advanced topics in mechanics of materials, emphasizing analysis and
design of load carrying members. Topics covered include: theories of
failure, torsion of open and closed sections, unsymmetrical bending,

curved beams, beams on elastic foundations, plane elasticity, and energy
methods of analysis. The course will highlight approximations necessary
to generate 'strength of materials' type solutions and address the impact
of these approximations on the reliability and robustness of member
design.
Prerequisite: CENG 3306 or equivalent or department chair approval.
