CENG 3325 - Structural Analysis
Introduction to structural requirements, structural systems and
specification of loads; analysis of statically determinate and
indeterminate structures using equations of equilibrium, moment
distribution, and energy methods; determination of design forces in the
structural components including shearing force and bending moment;
and brief introduction to the direct stiffness method. Three hours of
lecture per week.
Prerequisite: CENG 3306 or MENG 3306.
