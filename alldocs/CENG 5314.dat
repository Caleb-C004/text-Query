CENG 5314 - Advanced Structural Analysis
This course builds upon the material covered in CENG 3325 to develop
a better understanding of structural behavior. Matrix analysis methods,
including an introduction to finite elements are developed as the basis for
modern, computer-based structural analysis. These and other advanced
analytical techniques are used to analyze and design trusses, beams, and
frames. Course-work involves extensive use of the computer as an
analytical tool. Co-listed with CENG 4314. The graduate student will
complete and additional project.
Prerequisite: CENG 3325.
