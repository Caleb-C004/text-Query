ANTH 3380 - Physical Anthropology
On the basis of fossil and other physical evidence, physical anthropology
studies the origin of human species, the beginnings of culture, the role of
heredity and environment in the development of humans, and current
physical variation among human populations of the globe. In this course
we will also discuss issues like our biological and ethical relations to
other primates, the Neanderthal controversy, and the concept of "race."
