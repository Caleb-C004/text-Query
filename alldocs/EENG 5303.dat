EENG 5303 - Computational Methods in Electromagnetics
Numerical methods for the solution of boundary value problems in
electrical engineering applications: the finite difference method (FDM),
the charge simulation method (CSM), the method of moments (MOM)
and the boundary element method (BEM). Applications include the
simulation and modeling of electrostatics, magnetostatics,
electromagnetic problems, optimization of high voltage electrodes and
heat transfer problems. Three hours of lecture per week.
Prerequisite: EENG 3303, MATH 3203 and MATH 3305 or consent of
the instructor.
