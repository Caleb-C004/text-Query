COSC 3325 - Algorithm Analysis and Foundations
Introduction to foundations and formal techniques used to support the
design and analysis of algorithms, focusing on both the underlying
mathematical theory and practical considerations of efficiency. Topics
include asymptotic complexity bounds, techniques of analysis,
algorithmic strategies, basic computability, and complexity classes.
Prerequisite: COSC 2336 and MATH 2330.
