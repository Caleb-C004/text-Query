EENG 4315 - Senior Design II
The senior design project, which was begun in EENG 4115, continues to
completion. This capstone design project builds on previous course
work, includes all stages of the design process, and takes into account a
variety of realistic constraints such as manufacturability and
sustainability; economic factors; and environmental, safety, and
reliability issues. Preparation and presentation of final oral and written
reports are required. Nine hours of Design Studio Lab per week.
Prerequisite: EENG 4115.
