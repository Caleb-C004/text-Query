and Environmental Engineering
This course provides students with an introduction to the general
concepts and applications of Global Positioning Systems and Geographic
Information Systems through several project-based water resources and
environmental engineering applications. Through work on various realworld
problems, students develop insight with regard to spatial-based
applications and the diversity of each technology's potential applications.
The course will emphasize the use of both technologies as part of an
integrated planning and decision making process.
