ANTH 3330 - Cultural Anthropology
Using both humanistic and scientific approaches, cultural anthropology
offers a holistic, comparative perspective on human condition. The
nature, principles and comparative topics of culture -such as subsistence,
family, language, religion and art - will be studied. Visual examples will
be drawn from many cultures, offering students an opportunity to
appreciate both the complex cultural diversity and the common traits of
the world. Applications of anthropological knowledge to contemporary
problems will be discussed as well.
