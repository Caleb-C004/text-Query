ALHS 4335 - Global Health
Social, economic, and political forces powerfully influence who gets
sick, what diseases afflict human populations and the availability of
resources for prevention and treatment. Students will be introduced to
health related research and other learning materials that will help them to
recognize and understand these forces.
